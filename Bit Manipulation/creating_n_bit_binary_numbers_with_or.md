# Creating All \( n \)-Bit Binary Numbers Using OR Operations

## Introduction
Bitwise operations are fundamental in computer science and digital logic. One powerful operation is the bitwise OR, which can be used to combine bits from different numbers. This note explains how having the binary numbers that each have a single `1` bit at different positions allows you to create all possible \( n \)-bit binary numbers using OR operations.

## Explanation

### Binary Representation
Consider an \( n \)-bit number system. The set of numbers you need are:
- `100...0` (only the leftmost bit set, binary for \( 2^{n-1} \))
- `010...0` (only the second leftmost bit set, binary for \( 2^{n-2} \))
- `001...0` (only the third leftmost bit set, binary for \( 2^{n-3} \))
- ...
- `000...1` (only the rightmost bit set, binary for \( 2^0 \))

### Bitwise OR Operation
The bitwise OR operation compares each bit of two numbers and results in a `1` if either of the bits is `1`. Using this property, any \( n \)-bit binary number can be constructed by OR-ing together a subset of the above numbers.

### Creating All \( n \)-Bit Numbers
To create any \( n \)-bit number, consider its binary representation. For example, to create the number `110` in a 3-bit system:
- `100` OR `010` = `110`

In general, for any \( n \)-bit binary number, you can construct it by OR-ing together the appropriate subset of the set numbers:

- To form a binary number, include a number from the set if the corresponding bit in the target number is `1`.

### Example
Let's see how to create all 3-bit numbers using `100`, `010`, and `001`:

1. `000`:
   - Not OR-ing any numbers.

2. `001`:
   - `000` OR `001` = `001`

3. `010`:
   - `000` OR `010` = `010`

4. `011`:
   - `010` OR `001` = `011`

5. `100`:
   - `000` OR `100` = `100`

6. `101`:
   - `100` OR `001` = `101`

7. `110`:
   - `100` OR `010` = `110`

8. `111`:
   - `100` OR `010` OR `001` = `111`

### General Case
For any \( n \)-bit binary number, the set of numbers `100...0`, `010...0`, ..., `000...1` can be combined using OR operations to produce any possible \( n \)-bit number. This is due to the fact that each bit position can be individually set to `1` or `0` through the inclusion or exclusion of the corresponding number from the set.

## Conclusion
Using the bitwise OR operation with a set of numbers where each number has a single `1` bit in a unique position allows you to create any possible \( n \)-bit binary number. This technique leverages the fundamental properties of the OR operation to efficiently construct any desired binary pattern.

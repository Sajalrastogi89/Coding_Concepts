# Dealing with Negative Modulus Operations for Remainders

## Overview
When dealing with negative numbers and computing remainders using the modulus operation (%), it's essential to handle negative modulus operations correctly to ensure accurate results. In Java, the behavior of the modulus operator with negative numbers can sometimes lead to unexpected results if not handled properly.

## Approach
To deal with negative modulus operations for remainders, follow these steps:

1. **Understand Modulus Operator Behavior**:
   - In Java, the modulus operator (%) returns the remainder of the division operation.
   - For positive numbers, the result is straightforward.
   - For negative numbers, the behavior depends on the programming language and implementation.

2. **Adjust Negative Modulus**:
   - If dealing with negative numbers and computing remainders using the modulus operator, adjust the result to ensure it falls within the desired range.

3. **Handle Edge Cases**:
   - Consider edge cases where negative numbers and modulus operations might produce unexpected results.
   - Implement specific logic or conditions to handle such edge cases gracefully.

## Example
```java
// Example of handling negative modulus operations for remainders
int dividend = -10;
int divisor = 3;

// Calculate remainder with negative dividend
int remainder = (dividend % divisor + divisor) % divisor;

# Importance of Proper Placement of Curly Braces

## Problem Statement
Incorrect placement of curly braces in code can lead to unexpected behavior and errors. This is particularly true in languages like Java, where proper syntax and structure are crucial for the code to compile and execute correctly. 

## Common Constructs Affected
Improper placement of curly braces can affect the following language constructs:
- **Class**: Incorrectly placed curly braces can result in incomplete class definitions, leading to compilation errors.
- **Interface**: Similar to classes, interfaces require proper curly brace placement to define their structure correctly.
- **Enum**: Enums define a fixed set of constants, and any errors in their definition due to curly brace misplacement can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Example
```java
// Incorrect placement of curly braces for a class
public class MyClass
    public void myMethod() {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
} // Missing opening curly brace for class definition

// Incorrect placement of curly braces for an interface
public interface MyInterface
    void myMethod();
} // Missing opening curly brace for interface definition

// Incorrect placement of curly braces for an enum
public enum MyEnum {
    VALUE1,
    VALUE2,
} // Extra comma and missing closing curly brace for enum

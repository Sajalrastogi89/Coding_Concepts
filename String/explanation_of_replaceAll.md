# Explanation of `ans.replaceAll("^[0]*", "")`

The line `ans = ans.replaceAll("^[0]*", "");` is used to remove leading zeros from the binary string `ans`. Here's a detailed breakdown of what this line does:

## Breakdown
- `ans.replaceAll(...)`: This method is a part of the `String` class in Java and is used to replace each substring of the string that matches the given regular expression with the given replacement.
- `"^[0]*"`: This is the regular expression (regex) used for matching.
  - `^`: This asserts the position at the start of the string.
  - `[0]*`: This matches zero or more occurrences of the character '0'.
- `""`: This is the replacement string, which is an empty string in this case.

## Putting It Together
`ans.replaceAll("^[0]*", "")` means:
- Look for zero or more '0' characters at the beginning of the string `ans`.
- Replace this sequence of leading zeros with an empty string, effectively removing them.

## Examples

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `ans = "001100"`
   - Output: `ans.replaceAll("^[0]*", "")` will result in `"1100"` (leading zeros removed).

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `ans = "0000"`
   - Output: `ans.replaceAll("^[0]*", "")` will result in `""` (all zeros removed).

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `ans = "1010"`
   - Output: `ans.replaceAll("^[0]*", "")` will result in `"1010"` (no leading zeros to remove).

This ensures that the resulting binary string does not have any unnecessary leading zeros, which is especially useful for representing the binary number in a canonical form.

# Handling Ranges and Finding Common Numbers

## Overview
When dealing with ranges and finding common numbers within these ranges efficiently, a common approach is to utilize the concept of marking starting and ending indices with specific values. By marking the starting index with `+1` and the ending index with `-1`, we can efficiently track the range boundaries and identify common numbers within these ranges.

## Approach
1. **Marking Ranges**:
   - Iterate through the given ranges.
   - Mark the starting index of each range with `+1` and the ending index with `-1`.
   - This marking process helps in identifying the boundaries of each range.

2. **Traverse and Accumulate**:
   - Traverse through the marked indices.
   - Accumulate the markings by adding the previous value to the current value.
   - This step helps in identifying overlapping ranges and common numbers within these ranges.

3. **Find Maximum Value**:
   - After traversing through the marked indices and accumulating the values, find the maximum value obtained.
   - The maximum value represents the count of overlapping ranges at any given index, indicating the common numbers within these ranges.

## Example
```java
// Example of handling ranges and finding common numbers
int[] ranges = { {2, 5}, {3, 7}, {1, 6} };

// Marking ranges
int[] markers = new int[MAX_RANGE];
for (int[] range : ranges) {
    markers[range[0]] += 1; // Mark starting index with +1
    markers[range[1] + 1] -= 1; // Mark ending index with -1
}

// Traverse and accumulate markings
int currentValue = 0;
int maxValue = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
for (int i = 0; i < MAX_RANGE; i++) {
    currentValue += markers[i];
    maxValue = Math.max(maxValue, currentValue);
}
